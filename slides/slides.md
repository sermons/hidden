## 1 Peter 3:1-7 

>>>

1. Win without Words (1-2)
+ unbelieving / disbelieving / faithless to Word
  - actions / lifestyle, not whether call Chr
+ won over: profit, gain (biz)
  - his life / heart is the profit
  - goal is not to be free from him
  - but that he repent + become worthy hubby
  - (if he wants to leave, let him: peace)
+ (holy living: not participating in sin)
  - e.g. Korah rebels: households swept away
  - if fear for own safety or children's:
  - seek pro help now, w/o his knowledge
+ conduct: turning, daily life (not just words)
  - see: watch over, observe: he notices
  - impact of wife/mother on daily life
+ in fear, holy living: not of him but of God
  - e.g., reward child's tantrums by reacting
  - testimony: submit not bc he coerces but bc of reverence for God
  - *not* doormat: strong bc God calls to holiness

2. Strength in Submission (3-6)
A. Cosmetics (3) (application)
+ self-image: e.g., dress up not always for male gaze but to feel good about self
+ for men: what to notice / recog / val
  - singles: looking for in wife
  - hubbies: apprec / cultivate in wife

B. Gentle + Quiet (4) (principle)
+ but that's not me! 
+ "well-behaved women seldom make history" (Laurel Thatcher Ulrich)
  - obs of way things are, not how should be
  - not: misbehave to make history
  - but: history has overlooked impact of many gentle + quiet women
+ hidden: not inscrutable / enigmatic / duplicitous
  - but precious, treasured, sacred
+ gentle: meek, strong enough to be accommodating

C. Mothers in the Faith (5-6) (examples)
+ adorn (cosmos) self: effort, intent
+ submit to own hubby (not all men)
  - position underneath
  - helper: avail, but wait for his lead
  (most things hubby won't care, delegate)
+ Sarah (Gen18): didn't even believe angels, but trusted hubby
+ doing what is good
+ not fearing any intimidation (terror)

3. (7)

+ live: household, dwelling, daily home life
+ according to knowledge
+ weaker (cmp) vessel (utility, body)
+ give: apportion, assign, distribute
  - she deserves honor, i need to give it to her
+ fellow heirs of grace of life
  - God deemed her worthy, chose us to be team
