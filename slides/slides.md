Likewise, **wives**, <br>
be **subject** to your own husbands,

so that even if some do not **obey** the word, <br>
they may be **won** without a word 

by the **conduct** of their wives, <br>
[2](# "ref") 
when they see your <br>
**respectful** and **pure** conduct. 

[1 Peter 3:1-2 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
1. Win without Words (1-2)
+ unbelieving / disbelieving / faithless to Word
  - actions / lifestyle, not whether call Chr
+ won over: profit, gain (biz)
  - his life / heart is the profit
  - goal is not to be free from him
  - but that he repent + become worthy hubby
  - (if he wants to leave, let him: peace)

---
**Depart**, please, <br>
from the tents of these **wicked** men, <br>
and **touch** nothing of theirs, <br>
lest you be **swept away** with all their sins.

[Numbers 16:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (holy living: not participating in sin)
  - e.g. Korah rebels: households swept away
  - if fear for own safety or children's:
  - seek pro help now, w/o his knowledge

---
Likewise, **wives**, <br>
be **subject** to your own husbands,

Do not let your **adorning** be external —

the braiding of **hair** <br>
and the putting on of gold **jewelry**, <br>
or the **clothing** you wear —

[1 Peter 3:3 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
2. Strength in Submission (3-6)
A. Cosmetics (3) (application)
+ self-image: e.g., dress up not always for male gaze but to feel good about self
+ for men: what to notice / recog / val
  - singles: looking for in wife
  - hubbies: apprec / cultivate in wife

---
but let your adorning be <br>
the **hidden** person of the **heart**

with the **imperishable** beauty <br>
of a **gentle** and **quiet** spirit, 

which in God's sight is very **precious**. 

[1 Peter 3:4 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
B. Gentle + Quiet (4) (principle)
+ but that's not me! 
+ "well-behaved women seldom make history" (Laurel Thatcher Ulrich)
  - obs of way things are, not how should be
  - not: misbehave to make history
  - but: history has overlooked impact of many gentle + quiet women
+ hidden: not inscrutable / enigmatic / duplicitous
  - but precious, treasured, sacred
+ gentle: meek, strong enough to be accommodating
+ quiet: tranquil, undisturbed water, even

---
For this is how the **holy women** <br>
who **hoped** in God used to adorn themselves,

by **submitting** to their own husbands, <br>
[6](# "ref")
as **Sarah** obeyed Abraham, calling him **lord**. 

And you are her children, <br>
if you do **good** and do not fear <br>
anything that is **frightening**.

[1 Peter 3:5-6 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
C. Mothers in the Faith (5-6) (examples)
+ adorn (cosmos) self: effort, intent
+ submit to own hubby (not all men)
  - position underneath
  - helper: avail, but wait for his lead
  (most things hubby won't care, delegate)
+ Sarah (Gen18): even doubted angels, but trusted hubby
+ doing what is good
+ not fearing any intimidation (terror)

Likewise, **husbands**, 
**live** with your wives in an **understanding** way, 

showing **honor** to the woman 
as the **weaker** vessel, 

since they are **heirs** with you
of the grace of life, 
so that your **prayers** may not be hindered.

[1 Peter 3:7 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
3. Husbands (7)
+ likewise: all above applies to hubbies, too
+ live: household, dwelling, daily home life
+ according to knowledge
+ weaker (cmp) vessel (utility, body)
+ give: apportion, assign, distribute
  - she deserves honor, i need to give it to her
+ fellow heirs of grace of life
  - God deemed her worthy, chose us to be team
  - don't try to change wife into a man! 
  - diff thinking, approach to decision making, notice / attuned
  - treasure those diffs even as work together toward common goal of serving Christ
