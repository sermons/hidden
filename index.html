Likewise, husbands, **live** with your wives <br>
in an **understanding** way, 

[1 Peter 3:7a (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ "likewise": all above applies to hubbies, too
  + for sake of righteousness,
  + endure what might seem unfair
+ "live with": **dwell**, house: daily life, be present
  + know the theory vs live it out

______
+ "understanding": acc **knowledge**
  + observe **reality**, way things are
  + "just when think I know her, she confuses me!"
+ Know God's **Word** + God's **people** (daughter)
+ how God made **marriage**, how He made **her**
  + and how **my actions** affect her

showing honor to the woman <br>
as the **weaker vessel**, 

[1 Peter 3:7b (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ "weaker": as sickly, less **capacity** to fight/move
  + wife as help-meet: unique **strength**
  + God-designed mutual **dependency**
+ "vessel": **utility**, fit for purpose, body
+ How should we **treat** those who are weaker? 
  + **belittle** / look down on / less imp? 

---
On the contrary, the parts of the body <br>
that seem to be **weaker** are **indispensable**, 

[23](# "ref")
and on those parts of the body that we think <br>
**less** honorable we bestow the **greater honor**, 

and our **unpresentable** parts <br>
are treated with greater **modesty**

[1 Corinthians 12:22-23 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Same word "**weaker**": 
+ so she is **indispensable**: necessary
+ constrained: can't **survive** w/o her
+ cf v4 hidden: how she treats own heart
+ here: how hubby treats her heart

---
**showing honor** to the woman <br>
as the weaker vessel, 

[1 Peter 3:7b (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ "show": **apportion**, assign, distribute
  + she **deserves** honor, i need to **give** it
+ not just "**consider**" / think (internal)
  - but distribute, hand out, **give**:
  - God gave you **role** to give her honor

---
since they are **heirs** with you <br>
of the **grace** of life

[1 Peter 3:7c (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ **Co-heirs** of Christ's grace
  - God deemed her **worthy**, chose us to be **team**
+ Don't try to change wife into a **man**! 
  - diff **thinking**, approach to **decision** making,
  + things she **notices** / attuned
+ **Treasure** those diffs even as **work together**
  + toward common **goal** of serving Christ
+ Things I **learn** by watching her life, w/o words:
  + deeper understanding of how God **saves** us
  + effect of **pain**/suffering, finding **grace**
  + what **faith** means
  + **trusting** God when life doesn't make **sense**

---
so that your **prayers** may not be hindered.

[1 Peter 3:7c (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ **neglecting** to understand + **honor** wife
  - **harms** my rl w/God
+ bc it's God's **plan** that I learn Christ's love
  - by learning to **love her**
+ Doing so **habitually** improves my prayer life
  - hubbies: **prayer life** needs improvement?
