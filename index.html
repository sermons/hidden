Likewise, **wives**, <br>
be **subject** to your own husbands,

so that even if some do not **obey** the word, <br>
they may be **won** without a word 

by the **conduct** of their wives, <br>
[2](# "ref") 
when they see your <br>
**respectful** and **pure** conduct. 

[1 Peter 3:1-2 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ "disobedient": disbelieving / faithless to Word
  - actions / lifestyle, not whether call Chr
+ sure, willing to submit to good + kind hubby
  + but also to crooked? 
+ c.f. 2:18 house servants to master

+ "won": profit, gain (biz)
  - his life / heart is the profit
  - goal is not to be free from him
  - but that he repent + become worthy hubby
  - (if he wants to leave, let him: peace)

---
**Depart**, please, <br>
from the tents of these **wicked** men, <br>
and **touch** nothing of theirs, <br>
lest you be **swept away** with all their sins.

[Numbers 16:26 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ (holy living: not participating in sin)
+ e.g. Korah rebels: households swept away
+ if fear for own safety or children's:
+ get out of situation, seek qual help w/o him knowing

---
Likewise, **wives**, <br>
be **subject** to your own husbands,

they may be **won** without a word

[2](# "ref") 
when they see your <br>
**respectful** and **pure** conduct. 

[1 Peter 3:1-2 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ "conduct": turning, daily life (not just words)
  - impact of wife/mother on daily life
+ e.g., wife handles food dept
  - don't even remember how to order food
  - not that she overrules my prefs, but
  - my tastes have changed, now i
  - don't even want what I used to like to eat
+ home atmos: whether peaceful + content
  - or bitter + full of conflict

+ "respectful + pure": in fear, holy conduct: 
  - not of him but of God
  - e.g., reward child's tantrums by reacting
  - testimony: submit not bc he coerces but bc of reverence for God
  - *not* doormat: strong bc God calls to holiness

+ "see": watch over, observe: he notices
+ when you were dating / starting out,
  - wanted him to notice you: hairstyle, clothes
+ now you realize he has no clue abt your hair
  - but know that he does notice your life:
+ actions, words, attitude / tone
  - not just how you treat him, but
  - how interact w/others, rel, kids
  - how you view yourself

Do not let your **adorning** be external —

the braiding of **hair** <br>
and the putting on of gold **jewelry**, <br>
or the **clothing** you wear —

[1 Peter 3:3 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ of course are often judged on appearance
+ but those who focus so much on your exterior
  - prob don't know much about your interior
+ those who do know you, care about you
  - notice that inner beauty
  - that then shines outward in daily life
+ self-image: e.g., dress up not always for male gaze but to feel good about self
+ for men: what to notice / recog / val
  - singles: looking for in wife
  - hubbies: apprec / cultivate in wife

---
but let your adorning be <br>
the **hidden** person of the **heart**

with the **imperishable** beauty <br>
of a **gentle** and **quiet** spirit, 

which in God's sight is very **precious**. 

[1 Peter 3:4 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
v4: hidden: encrypted
+ not obfuscated, deliberately indecipherable:
  - tho men: she makes no sense
  - tho women: don't understand myself
+ but covered: protected, precious, treasured

v4: person of heart:
+ not just inner thoughts / feelings
  - but core of who you are:
  - the true you, the way God made you
+ made for rl of love w/perfect Father:
  - immersed in His grace + protection,
  - responding w/ gentleness + peace

v4: gentleness: meek, strength withheld
v4: quiet: still water, undisturbed, equanimity
+ s.times think must fight for self, win respect:
  - "how can I be gentle? Ppl will walk over me!"
+ or was peaceful until hubby ruined it:
  - "I am at peace -- he makes me not at peace!"
+ can't generate by willpower / trying harder
  - fruit of your spirit as transformed by HS
+ rooted in identity as God's beloved daughter
  - indep of circumstances: shows power
+ doesn't decay, spoil, corrupt

v4: great worth: valuable, riches
+ God deems gentle+quiet spirit as good thing
+ let go of "right to be angry"
+ endure suff. bc God calls us to righteousness

+ but that's not me! 
+ "well-behaved women seldom make history" (Laurel Thatcher Ulrich)
  - obs of way things are, not how should be
  - not: misbehave to make history
  - but: history has overlooked impact of many gentle + quiet women
+ hidden: not inscrutable / enigmatic / duplicitous
  - but precious, treasured, sacred
+ gentle: meek, strong enough to be accommodating
+ quiet: tranquil, undisturbed water, even

For this is how the **holy women** <br>
who **hoped** in God used to adorn themselves,

by **submitting** to their own husbands, <br>
[6](# "ref")
as **Sarah** obeyed Abraham, calling him **lord**. 

And you are her children, <br>
if you do **good** and do not fear <br>
anything that is **frightening**.

[1 Peter 3:5-6 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ adorn (cosmos) self: effort, intent
+ submit to own hubby (not all men)
  - position underneath
  - helper: avail, but wait for his lead
  (most things hubby won't care, delegate)
+ Sarah (Gen18): even doubted angels, but trusted hubby

v5: hoped in God
+ c.f. 2:23: Christ didn't respond in kind, but
  - gave over to One who judges righteously

v6: frightening/terror
+ don't **revenge**: c.f. v9, 12
+ don't **fear** what they fear: v14
+ v2 fear
+ doing what is good

>>>

Likewise, **husbands**, **live** with your wives <br>
in an **understanding** way, 

showing **honor** to the woman <br>
as the **weaker** vessel, 

since they are **heirs** with you of the grace of life, <br>
so that your **prayers** may not be hindered.

[1 Peter 3:7 (ESV)](# "rev")

>>>
+ likewise: all above applies to hubbies, too
+ live: household, dwelling, daily home life
+ according to knowledge
+ weaker (cmp) vessel (utility, body)
+ give: apportion, assign, distribute
  - she deserves honor, i need to give it to her
+ fellow heirs of grace of life
  - God deemed her worthy, chose us to be team
  - don't try to change wife into a man! 
  - diff thinking, approach to decision making, notice / attuned
  - treasure those diffs even as work together toward common goal of serving Christ

v7: similarly: same principle:
+ for sake of righteousness,
+ endure what might seem unfair

v7: live with: dwell, house: daily life, be present
+ know the theory vs live it out
+ SS kids tell all family secrets!
+ not just about the one time I did sth nice
+ "temporary" stress becomes long-term becomes habit becomes way of life

v7: knowledge: observe reality, way things are
+ "just when think I know her, she foils me!"
+ know God's Word + God's people (daughter)
+ how God made marriage, how He made her
  - and how my actions affect her
+ e.g., wife: "why yelling at me?"
  - not malicious, but ignorant / unaware
  - pressing gas pedal harder than I thought

v7: weaker: as sickly, less capacity to fight/mov
+ wife as help-meet: strength
+ vessel: of use, fit for purpose, body
+ submit: position underneath leadership
+ God-designed mutual dependency
+ how should we treat the weaker? 
  - belittle / look down on / less imp? 
+ members of body: special honour, protect
  - cf v4 hidden: how she treats own heart
  - here: how hubby treats her heart

v7: assign honor as co-heir
+ God deems her worthy of honour
  - so should you
+ not just "consider" / think (internal)
  - but distribute, hand out, give:
  - God gave you role to give her honor
+ appreciate her as co-heir:
  - things learned by watching her, not taught:
+ deeper understanding of how God saves us
  - what faith means
  - effect of pain/suffering, finding grace
  - trusting God when life doesn't make sense

v7: prayers:
+ neglecting to understand + honor wife
  - harms my rl w/God
+ bc God's plan that I learn Christ's love for me
  - by learning to love her
+ doing so habitually improves my prayer life
  - hubbies: prayer life needs improvement?
